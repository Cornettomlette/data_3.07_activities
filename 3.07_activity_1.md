# 3.07 Activity 1

Keep working on the `bank` database.

Modify the previous query to obtain the percentage of variation in the number of users compared with previous month.

```sql
-- the previous query:
with cte_activity as (
  select Active_users, lag(Active_users,1) over (partition by Activity_year) as last_month, Activity_year, Activity_month
  from Monthly_active_users
)
select * from cte_activity
where last_month is not null;
```
